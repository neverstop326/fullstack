    <p>Introducing myself, I studied Business in a university in Korea. 
       Though I don't have experience in computer programming, 
      I am eager to learn in Full Stack Development courses.
      Blockchain is one of the newly created technology that has lots of possibilities.
      My goal is to finish Blockchain Development and be a professional in this field.
      I am enjoying this course so much.
